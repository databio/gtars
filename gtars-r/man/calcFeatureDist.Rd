\title{Calculate feature distances (signed)}
\usage{
calcFeatureDist(query, features)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{A GRanges object, file path, or RegionSet pointer}

\item{features}{A GRanges object, file path, or RegionSet pointer of
feature locations (e.g., TSS sites)}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of signed distances
}
\description{
Calculates the signed distance from each query region to its
nearest feature. Positive = feature is downstream, negative = upstream.
Port of GenomicDistributions::calcFeatureDist.
